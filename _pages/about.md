👋🏻 Hi, my name is José!

💻 I’m a Software Engineer focused on analyzing project requirements to design, build and develop scalable and efficient architectures that align with business objectives.

🚀 I’m passionate about solving complex problems, researching innovative solutions, and adapting them to diverse contexts. I strongly believe that exploring how challenges are addressed in different programming languages provides a broad perspective, enhancing software development and optimizing results.

🎯 One of my biggest motivations is learning. This is why I constantly read tech blogs to stay updated on where top companies are heading. I focus on emerging technologies, diving deep into them to understand their inner workings and put them into practice. This continuous exploration allows me to stay at the forefront of innovation and enhance my skills by experimenting with new tools and techniques.
